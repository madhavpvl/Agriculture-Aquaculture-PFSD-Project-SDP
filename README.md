AIM - To use the AI Automated drone technology for farming and aquaculture
No alt text provided for this image
As we are the students of UG in K L University. We have a subject that tells us about the design aspects of every project or business system. So with the help of that subject and also with the combination of many subjects, we had created a small regarding "Agriculture & Aquaculture Systems (AAS)"
In this field, we did a lot of research and concluded to work on this particular topic that we feel is important in our business system.

Agriculture & Aquaculture Systems
Agriculture is one of the most important parts of our country. Without the farmers, we can't even have our food. We need to support them with the help of our education in a proper way such that it may reduce their work.
Agriculture & Aqua Culture are not different the only minor difference is agriculture is the growth of plants whereas aquaculture is the growth of a fish. A combination of different works will lead to the final result of the farming.
User Research
The Study of Target Users
Our business system's main target group is the farmers.
Our main aim is the usage of AI Automated Drone for spraying fertilizers in the fields without manpower
We are having an idea to sell the drones which are automated and attached with a heat sensor with which we can detect the insects easily. We will build a website with which farmers can access or else we also provide a Telecommunication service with which farmers can use our service with some minimal cost.
By Applying the Design Thinking Techniques, we easily completed our research and found the errors in our case study.

Research and Findings
Questions to understand the user group
How much money does it require to spray fertilizer in a field?
How to calculate the amount of fertilizer to be used in that field?
What do we need to do if insects are more in one particular place? Do we need to spray more fertile?
At what timings do we need to spray the fertilizer in a field?
How much manpower is required to complete the spray process in a field?

Responses from Farmers
How much money does it require to spray fertilizer in a field? It depends upon the type of fertilizer we use it costs around 1990/- for 25kg's Agricultural Grade Potassium Scheonite Fertilizers, where it is used for 1 acre for growing rice fields. Also, we need to include the labour charges which they charge around 1000/- per acre. So it costs us around 3000/- per acre to spray fertilizer with manpower.
How to calculate the amount of fertilizer to be used in that field? Amount of fertiliser kg/ha = kg/ha nutrient รท % nutrient in fertiliser x 100. Example: You need 20 units (kg) /ha of phosphorus (P) and you plan to use single superphosphate with 8.8% P.
What do we need to do if insects are more in one particular place? Do we need to spray more fertilizer? It doesn't happen many times anyways the pesticide will work strongly even if more insects don't matter if insects are only at one place. But if we increase the chemical content it affects the health of the person who consumes it.
At what timings do we need to spray the fertilizer in a field? Generally speaking, the best time to fertilize landscape plants is around the time they begin to grow actively. The worst time to fertilize plants is at the end of their growing season. Trees, for example, begin to wake up and grow in early spring, and typically are fertilized once in February or March.
How much manpower is required to complete the spray process in a field? We take 5 to 6 people to spray fertilizers in our land such that work will become faster with more people.

Interview Report
The very first week we engaged ourselves with farmers and got some information regarding the process of using fertilizers.
Users had low limited knowledge about mobile phones and their usage.
We had learned different methods to use fertilizers and how to calculate the usage of them.
We faced a situation where the user don't know how to complete the online payment.
We found that many farmers lack proper education they are not aware of drone procedures and they are also worried about their crop.
Many farmers don't want to risk their crops by using drone methodology because of their fear.

The Final Users
Farmer:- The farmer needs to access his laptop/mobile and open this application and need to enter the size of the field such that according to his field size we will fix the drone which he need to use accordingly he need to enter the name of the fertilizer else he can use his own fertilizer but for using his own fertilizer we charge extra money because that fertilizer should be sent into a machine which can be done only by our technical team else we will send the drone along with the fertilizer and then we will deliver the drone to that particular place and then it will spray the fertilizer in the field and he need to return back the machine after the usage.
Technical Team:- This person will take the drone from the office and launch it there and work on it accordingly and return back the drone to the office accordingly after usage.
Administrator:- Here the administrator needs to collect all the responses from the farmers who used drones with the help of that response he needs to assign those ratings to that drone service and also make sure there will be customer feedback present there.
Conclusion
So this is all about our SDP-2 our main aim is to reduce the spraying time for farmers with fertilizers. By making this procedure online through a mobile application. We are so happy if it reaches to correct set of people and works perfectly without any problem.
